Imud.py protocol v0.1

All communication is in ascii plain text.
All commands sent to the server must be terminated by '\n' i.e. by a new line character.
All messages from the server are terminated by '\n' i.e. by a new line character.

Responses from the server for valid commands always end with 'OK\n'
Unknown or otherwise invalid commands return 'huh\n'

Initial Connection:
	No initial command is required from the client.
	On connection the server returns 'hello\n', a version string (e.g. 'v0.1\n'), a list of available data (e.g. 'available:iuohtp\n'), the current data values, and finally 'OK\n'
	At this point it is up to the client whether to close the connection or to keep it open for future polled or pushed updates.

Available Data:
	A list of codes indicating what data is available. Meaning is as follows:

	i	is the IMU inverted?
	u	interval between pushed updates (seconds)
	o	orientation angles of IMU x, y, and z axis (degrees)
	h	compass heading
	t	temperature (degrees C)
	p	pressure (hPa)

Interpreting Data:
	Actual data format varies however each data line takes the form <data id code>:<data string>\n e.g. t:22.3\n
	Converting the data string into usable objects in python may be achieved with the literal_eval function of the ast module. See clients/parsed.py for one way to do this.

Querying Data:
	To read all available data send '?\n' to ther server.
	To read a specific data item send '?<data item id>\n' e.g. '?t\n'

Pushed Updates:
	The server can be configured to push all available data to the client at a specified interval. To enabled pushed updates send 'u=<seconds>\n' e.g. 'u=3.3\n'. Too small values for 'u' will add significantly to cpu load and return duplicate data.
	Pushed updates may be disabled by sending 'u=0\n'.
	Note: setting 'u' does not change how often the sensors are read just how often the data is pushed to the client.
